# CODI Explorer

This is a fork of the open-source project https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui, which has been modified for CODI's API documentation. The Jensoleg project was a modified fork of [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API. Learn more about Swagger [here](http://swagger.io).
